# Italianos
Final Project for C#

# Overview
Italianos by Kevin Dimarco and Brandon Sheppard. 

This was our final project for our C# ASP .NET class. This web application is used to make, edit, and cancel reservations online. The project utilizes databases to store the account information and reservations. It also uses an email forwarder to notify you about upcoming reservations. 

This project is meant to be downloaded and placed in Visual Studio and then run inside your favourite web browser.
